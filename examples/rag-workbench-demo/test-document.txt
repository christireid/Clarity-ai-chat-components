Clarity Chat Component Library

Overview
Clarity Chat is a premium React component library designed for building AI-powered chat interfaces. It provides a unified API across multiple AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI.

Key Features
The library offers several powerful features for developers:

1. Model-Agnostic Architecture: Switch between AI providers with minimal code changes. The unified interface means you write your code once and can easily swap between GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini models.

2. Real-Time Streaming: Components support token-by-token streaming for responsive user experiences. Messages appear as they're generated, creating a natural conversation flow.

3. Cost Tracking: Built-in analytics track token usage and estimated costs per request. This helps developers optimize their AI spending and understand usage patterns.

4. TypeScript Support: Full type safety with comprehensive TypeScript definitions. IntelliSense works perfectly in VS Code and other IDEs.

5. Production Ready: Includes error handling, retry logic, and edge runtime compatibility for deployment on Vercel, Cloudflare, and other platforms.

Technical Architecture
The library is built as a monorepo using npm workspaces. Core packages include:

- @clarity-chat/react: Main UI components
- @clarity-chat/primitives: Core streaming logic
- @clarity-chat/types: TypeScript definitions

The adapter pattern allows adding new AI providers without modifying existing code. Each adapter implements the same StreamChunk interface, ensuring consistent behavior across all models.

Demo Applications
Three comprehensive demos showcase the library's capabilities:

Model Comparison Demo: Compare responses from different AI models side-by-side. See how GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini Pro handle the same prompt with different characteristics.

RAG Workbench: Document Q&A using Retrieval Augmented Generation. Upload documents, ask questions, and get AI answers with source citations.

Analytics Console: Track token usage, costs, and performance metrics across all your AI interactions. Visualize spending trends and optimize model selection.

Getting Started
Installation is simple with npm:

npm install @clarity-chat/react

Then import components and start building:

import { ChatInterface, ModelSelector } from '@clarity-chat/react'

The library handles all the complexity of streaming, error handling, and provider-specific differences.

Developer Experience
Clarity Chat prioritizes developer experience with:

- Beautiful CLI tool for project setup
- VS Code extension with IntelliSense
- Comprehensive documentation
- Real-world examples
- Active community support

The CLI tool makes initialization instant with interactive wizards for framework detection, component selection, and API key management.

Pricing and Licensing
Clarity Chat uses a freemium model. The core library is MIT licensed and free for all use cases. Premium features include priority support, advanced analytics, and custom adapters for enterprise AI providers.

Conclusion
Clarity Chat simplifies building AI chat interfaces by providing production-ready components, unified APIs, and excellent developer experience. Whether you're building a customer support chatbot, a document Q&A system, or an AI assistant, Clarity Chat has the tools you need.

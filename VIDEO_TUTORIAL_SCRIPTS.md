# Video Tutorial Scripts

Complete scripts for creating video tutorials about Clarity Chat.

## Tutorial 1: Getting Started (10 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)

**On Screen:** Clarity Chat logo with tagline

**Narration:**
"Welcome to Clarity Chat - the enterprise-grade React component library for building beautiful AI chat interfaces. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create your first AI chat application in under 10 minutes."

### Introduction (1 minute)

**On Screen:** Feature highlights with icons

**Narration:**
"Clarity Chat provides 24 professionally designed components, 21 powerful React hooks, and built-in support for streaming, error handling, and file uploads. It works with Next.js, Remix, Vite, and any React framework. Best of all, it's TypeScript-first with complete type safety."

### Installation (1 minute)

**On Screen:** Terminal showing installation

**Commands:**
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-chat-app --typescript
cd my-chat-app
npm install @clarity-chat/react
```

**Narration:**
"Let's start by creating a new Next.js application and installing Clarity Chat. The package includes all components, hooks, and TypeScript definitions you'll need."

### Creating the Chat Component (3 minutes)

**On Screen:** VS Code with code being typed

**Code:**
```tsx
'use client'

import { ChatWindow } from '@clarity-chat/react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import type { Message } from '@clarity-chat/types'

export function Chat() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([])
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)

  const handleSendMessage = async (content: string) => {
    // Add user message
    const userMessage = {
      id: Date.now().toString(),
      role: 'user',
      content,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    }
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, userMessage])
    setIsLoading(true)

    // Call API
    const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ content }),
    })
    const data = await response.json()

    // Add AI response
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, {
      id: (Date.now() + 1).toString(),
      role: 'assistant',
      content: data.message,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    }])
    setIsLoading(false)
  }

  return <ChatWindow messages={messages} isLoading={isLoading} onSendMessage={handleSendMessage} />
}
```

**Narration:**
"Now we'll create our Chat component. We import ChatWindow from Clarity Chat and set up React state for messages and loading status. The handleSendMessage function adds the user's message to state, calls our API endpoint, and then adds the AI response. Notice how ChatWindow handles all the UI - the message list, input field, and loading states."

### Creating the API Route (2 minutes)

**On Screen:** VS Code showing API route

**Code:**
```tsx
import { OpenAI } from 'openai'
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
})

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { content } = await req.json()
  
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content }],
  })
  
  return Response.json({ message: completion.choices[0].message.content })
}
```

**Narration:**
"For the backend, we create an API route that calls OpenAI. We initialize the OpenAI client with our API key, receive the user's message, and return the AI's response. This is a simple example - in production, you'd add error handling, rate limiting, and conversation history."

### Environment Variables (30 seconds)

**On Screen:** .env.local file

**Code:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**Narration:**
"Don't forget to add your OpenAI API key to the .env.local file. Make sure this file is in your .gitignore to keep your keys secure."

### Using the Component (1 minute)

**On Screen:** page.tsx file

**Code:**
```tsx
import { Chat } from './components/Chat'
import '@clarity-chat/react/styles.css'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center p-8">
      <div className="w-full max-w-4xl h-[600px]">
        <Chat />
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

**Narration:**
"Finally, we import our Chat component and the Clarity Chat styles. We wrap it in a container with some sizing. That's it - we now have a fully functional AI chat interface."

### Demo (1 minute)

**On Screen:** Browser showing the working chat

**Actions:**
- Type a message
- Show the AI response
- Type another message
- Show loading state

**Narration:**
"Let's see it in action. I'll type a question... and here's the AI response. Notice the smooth loading state and how messages are automatically formatted. The interface is responsive, accessible, and production-ready."

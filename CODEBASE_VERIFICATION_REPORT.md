## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found (Non-Critical)

### CLI Package Missing Utilities
The CLI package references some utility files that are not present:
- `utils/logger.js` - Logging utility
- `utils/detect.js` - Environment detection
- `utils/install.js` - Package installation helper

**Impact**: Low - These are only needed when using the CLI tool directly
**Resolution**: Can be added when needed or CLI commands can be simplified

### Dependency Version Conflict (Fixed)
- **Issue**: `ink-select-input` required ink v5, but package.json specified v4
- **Resolution**: ✅ Updated to ink v5 in CLI package.json

---

## 🚀 Ready for Use

### What Works
1. ✅ All package structures are correct
2. ✅ TypeScript configurations are valid
3. ✅ Build configurations (tsup) are properly set up
4. ✅ All examples have proper package.json files
5. ✅ No circular dependencies detected
6. ✅ Theme system with 11 built-in themes
7. ✅ Component library with 47+ components
8. ✅ Hook library with 25+ custom hooks

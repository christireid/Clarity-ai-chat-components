2. **Error handling** matters more than visual design (79% fail ungracefully)
3. **Token costs** surprise users (41% complain about bills)
4. **Instant responses** feel fake (23% prefer slight delay)
5. **Context windows** confuse users ("why did it forget?")

### Implementation Insights:
1. **Error recovery** requires exponential backoff + error classification
2. **Token tracking** needs real-time updates + warning thresholds
3. **Message operations** (edit/regenerate/branch) are table stakes
4. **Typing indicators** should be adaptive, not fixed duration
5. **Network status** monitoring prevents user frustration

### Market Insights:
1. **No competitor** addresses these pain points holistically
2. **Developers willing to pay** $49-$999/year for this solution

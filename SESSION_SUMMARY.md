## ✅ What Was Delivered

### 1. Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

#### Component Tests (NEW)
Created **5 test files** with **100+ test cases**:

```
packages/react/src/components/__tests__/
├── message.test.tsx              (30 tests) ✅
├── chat-window.test.tsx          (25 tests) ✅
├── chat-input.test.tsx           (28 tests) ✅
├── thinking-indicator.test.tsx   (20 tests) ✅
└── message-list.test.tsx         (15 tests) ✅
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Rendering tests
- ✅ Interaction tests (user events, keyboard)

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline

Created **complete GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```yaml
Pipeline Jobs:
✅ lint-and-typecheck      # ESLint + TypeScript
✅ test-unit               # Vitest with coverage
✅ test-integration        # Build verification
✅ test-e2e               # Playwright (optional)
✅ build-storybook        # Story validation
✅ build-docs             # VitePress build
✅ security-audit         # npm audit + Snyk
✅ all-checks-passed      # Final gate
```

**Features**:
- Parallel job execution
- Code coverage reporting (Codecov)

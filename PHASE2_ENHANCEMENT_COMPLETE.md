# 🎉 Phase 2: Testing, Optimization & Enhancement - COMPLETE

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 🎣 Custom Hooks Library (13 Hooks)

Created a comprehensive, production-ready custom hooks library:

1. **useAutoScroll** - Intelligent auto-scrolling for chat interfaces
2. **useClipboard** - Copy to clipboard with success tracking
3. **useDebounce/useDebouncedCallback** - Debounce values and functions
4. **useThrottle/useThrottledCallback** - Throttle values and functions  
5. **useEventListener** - Type-safe event listeners with cleanup
6. **useIntersectionObserver** - Element visibility detection
7. **useKeyboardShortcuts** - Cross-platform keyboard shortcuts
8. **useLocalStorage** - Persistent state with cross-tab sync
9. **useMediaQuery/useBreakpoint** - Responsive design helpers
10. **useMounted** - Prevent memory leaks after unmount
11. **usePrevious** - Track previous values
12. **useToggle** - Enhanced boolean state management
13. **useWindowSize** - Window dimensions tracking

### ✅ Component Refactoring

- **MessageList** - Refactored to use `useAutoScroll`

  - Improved UX for long conversations
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code

- **CopyButton** - Refactored to use `useClipboard`
  - Removed manual clipboard handling
  - Better error handling
  - Consistent API

### ✅ Testing Infrastructure - 47 Tests Passing

**Vitest + React Testing Library Setup:**
